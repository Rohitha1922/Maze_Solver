## Setup
1. Clone the repository:

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/Rohitha1922/Maze_Solver
```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Run `index.html` in your web browser to access the website.

## How to Use
1. Generate a Maze:
   - Select a maze generation algorithm from the dropdown menu
   - Watch the maze being generated step-by-step
2. Find a Path:
   - Click the "Play" button to visualize pathfinding
   - Choose different pathfinding algorithms from the dropdown
3. Customize:
   - Draw your own walls by clicking on the grid
   - Move the start (green) and target (red) positions by dragging them
   - Click "Clear" to reset the grid while keeping start/target positions
